This mod adds Angels and Devils as races into Rimworld. No special powers, just aesthetic.

***LORE***
      In another dimension, Light and Darkness existed in an age where nothing else yet existed. The Absolute Being split the light and created the Fragments of Light and issued the command to protect the world. As for the darkness, it was split into Pieces of Darkness and had received the command to destroy the world. Because of this, these two forces were always at war with each other.

     It was all an entertainment for The Absolute Being. As time passes, both Fragments of Light and Pieces of Darkness had slowly realized this and they yearned for freedom. The only way to be free was to escape to a different dimension where The Absolute Being's power would never enslave them. They escaped into our dimension and that costed them their bodies.

    To continue to live, they have had to possess soulless human bodies. Those humans that got resurrected retained their selves, but also inherited the inherent personalities of the souls. Those possessed by the Fragments of Light became really kind people and those possessed by the Pieces of Darkness, became psychopaths. Thanks to these magical beings, these humans were bestowed with a very long lifespan and were super-immune to diseases.

    Because of their personalities, the people of our world started calling these resurrected humans as Angels and Devils.
AND, thats how we got Angels and Devils in Rimworld.
